        <h4>
            The following is a partial history of me.
        </h4>
        <p>
            My name is Sara. My brother and I were raised by our Japanese mother who decided to stay in the United States despite impoverishment and divorce. Her spirit, however, was not broken. She went on to start a business that became successful due to her creative nature and driven work ethic. Why do I mention this? Well, for one, I believe our personal histories are an important part of who we are now. I was raised as a Japanese American, and that is who I am now, and at my core, that is who I will always be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided, despite un-ideal life conditions or perhaps because of those conditions, to join the LearningFuze full-immersion program Cohort 6. I realized that the direction I was heading in, in every facet of my life (career, academics, lifestyle, stress-level), was NOT what I wanted in my life. I decided that I had to be true to myself or I would regret it. From there I decided, I wanted to join the world! And the world is full of technology and I have a pure belief that whatever you want to do, you can do it. And so I decided I will learn to code, and be damn good at it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am hungry for a job that is creative, challenging, and positive. Being able to contribute to something good, as well as, learn and grow on the job, would be an ideal job for me. I love art and functionality, so making art through web design and creating a visually pleasing and functional web application would be a goal worth striving for.
